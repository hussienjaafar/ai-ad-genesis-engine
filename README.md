## Analytics Dashboard

The Analytics Dashboard provides comprehensive metrics and insights for your advertising campaigns:

- View key performance indicators like Spend, ROAS, CPL, and CTR
- Analyze trends with interactive charts
- Discover pattern insights to optimize your ads

**Note:** Charts display once at least one day of performance data is ingested.

## Insight-Driven Generation

Our platform identifies winning elements from your existing ads and helps you leverage them for new content:

1. The Analytics Dashboard automatically identifies high-performing patterns in your ad content
2. Click "Generate Variation" on any insight to create new content based on that winning element
3. Choose the content type (Facebook, Google, Video) and customize as needed
4. New content is tagged with the source insight for performance tracking

This data-driven approach helps improve your marketing ROI by learning from past successes.

## Authentication

This application uses a secure cookie-based authentication system:

### How it works:
1. Access tokens are short-lived (15 minutes) and stored only in memory
2. Refresh tokens are long-lived (7 days) and stored as HTTP-only cookies
3. When the access token expires, the system automatically refreshes it using the cookie

### Using Swagger UI:
1. Navigate to `/docs` endpoint
2. Click the "Authorize" button at the top
3. Under "cookieAuth", the refresh token cookie will be automatically included
4. Protected endpoints will now work with your authentication

### Security Features:
- Access tokens are never stored in localStorage
- Refresh tokens are HttpOnly cookies (not accessible via JavaScript)
- CORS is configured to allow credentials only from whitelisted origins
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attempts
